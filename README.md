# BlackJack
'BlackJack' is my personal take on reimplementing Casino BlackJack.
'BlackJack' is CLI game.

###### To try out 'BlackJack':
1) ****If you are on Window****, you need to open logic.py and, on line 6, replace `os.system('clear')` with `os.system('cls')`. Then you can run main.py
2) **If you are on Mac or Linux**, you just need to run main.py.

###### Quick demo:

This demo didn't cover:
- BlackJack 
- Split rule

#### **What I have learned:**
- Improve OOP knowledge
- Override `__repr__` to debug
- String format
- Do not import variables `from A import x1` but practice `A.x1` instead.
